# Predicting Heart Disease in Switzerland's Population
## 1. Introduction
Heart disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, including in Switzerland. Early and accurate prediction of heart disease can significantly improve patient outcomes through timely interventions. This project aims to utilize data science algorithms and techniques to predict the presence of heart disease in individuals based on various health attributes provided in the UCI Heart Disease dataset, specifically focusing on the Switzerland subset of the data.
